Test Report:
	Yoodlize is a site with great potential, that only needs some attention to a few important details before it can marry a great concept with great execution. 
	When the user first encounters Yoodlize, they are drawn in immediately by bright colors and friendly, sans-serif fonts. After the user finds the sign-up function, signing up for a new account is easy and intuitive.
	After a strong start, however, some issues show:
1.	While signing up is easy, if a user forgets their password, the “forgot password” function does not work.
2.	Once a user posts an item for rent, that item doesn’t stay on their profile page, and it cannot be edited.
3.	When searching for items through the “See All” links shown on the front page for each category, not all the items will be displayed.
4.	Login does not work on different browsers.
5.	Items only display when the user who posted them is logged in.
Those are some of the major issues. I’m sure with a little more time we can give the site a thorough check and help develop an action plan for fixing any problems.
